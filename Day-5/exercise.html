    <h1>The Evolution of Computers: A Brief Timeline</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Early Mechanical Computers (1800s - 1930s)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1822</strong> - Charles Babbage designed the Difference Engine, an early mechanical calculator.</li>
            <li><strong>1837</strong> - Babbage conceptualized the Analytical Engine, a programmable mechanical computer.</li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - Alan Turing developed the concept of a Turing Machine, the foundation of modern computing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. First Generation (1940s - 1950s)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1943-1944</strong> - The Colossus computer was developed to break Geramn codes during the World War II.</li>
            <li><strong>1946</strong> - The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) became the first general purpose electronic computer.</li>
            <li><strong>1951</strong> - The first commercial computer, UNIVAC I, was introduced.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - Computers started using transistors instead of vaccum tubes, making them smaller and faster.</li>
            <li><strong>1959</strong> - IBM introduced the <strong>IBM 1401,</strong> one of the first mass-produced computers.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1964</strong> - IBM released the <strong>System/360</strong>, which popularized the concept of family computers.</li>
            <li><strong>1969</strong> - The development of <strong>ARPANET</strong>, the precursor to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
