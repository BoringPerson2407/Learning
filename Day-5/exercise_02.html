    <div>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Born: </strong> July 10, 1856 <br>

            Nikola Tesla was born into a Serbian family. His father was a priest and a writer, while his mother, though unschooled, was highly inventive. From an early age, Tesla showed an extraordinary ability to memorize books and solve complex mathematical problems in his head.

        <h2>Education and Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Tesla sudied electrical engineering at the <strong>Austrian Polytechnic</strong> but never completer his degree. He later worked for <strong>Edison's Company</strong> in Paris, where he gained pracical experience with electrical systems. In 1884, he immigrated to United States to work under <strong>Thomas Edison</strong>, but their differing views on electricity soon led to a rivalry.

        <h2>Inventions and Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            Tesla is best known for his work on <strong>Alternating Current (AC)</strong>, which became the stadard for electrical power distribution. Some of his most notable inventions and Contributions include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AC Power System</strong> - A more efficient electrical system than Edison's direct current (DC).</li>
                <li><strong>Tesla Coil</strong> - A high-voltage transfromer still used in wireless technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Radio Waves</strong> - Pioneered wireless communication before Marconi.</li>
                <li><strong>X-Rays</strong> - Conducted early experiments with radiation.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireless Electricity</strong> - Dreamed of transmitting electricity without wires, leading to the <strong>Wardenclyffe Town</strong> project.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Later Years and Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled financially in his later years. He lived in a hotel in New york, often feeding pigeons and working on secret inventions. He passed away on <strong>January 7, 1943, </strong>alone but respected as one of the greatest inventions in hsitory. <br><br>
            Today, his contributions power the modern world, and he is recognised as visionary ahead of his time. Companies like <strong>Tesla</strong>, Inc. (Founded by Elon Musk) carry his legay forward.
